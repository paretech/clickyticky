# ClickyTicky - "An Image Reticle WebApp"

A minimalist web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that displays an image and overlays a reticle (horizontal and vertical lines) that follows the user's mouse. After cycling through some images on the local system and labeling a few points, the user can download a JSON file correlating to files and the image coordinate locations marked.
